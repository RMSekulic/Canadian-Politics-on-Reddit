Can I Hear Me Now? 
Echo Chambers in Online Discourse

I am currently migrating the hosting for the article material, and so for now, pdfs of the articles are saved here alongside the code. 
The PDFs contain all the content - though the formatting is not perfect. 
Once they have been migrated I will add a link to the new location here, but leave the PDFs available for any who have arrived here using the github link. 

Hope you enjoy!
